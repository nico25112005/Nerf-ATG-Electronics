# Nerf-ATG-Electronics

This repository contains the electronic design files for a custom printed circuit board (PCB) developed to enhance Nerf LaserOps blasters. The board utilizes an ESP32-S3 microcontroller to manage the blaster's functions and communicate via Bluetooth with a Unity application.

## Features

- Custom PCB design for Nerf LaserOps blasters
- ESP32-S3 microcontroller for improved performance and connectivity
- Bluetooth Classic for communication with a Unity application

## Installation

1. **PCB Assembly:**

   - Solder the components onto the board as per the schematic and Bill of Materials (BOM).

2. **Firmware Flashing:**

   - Flash the firmware onto the ESP32-S3. The firmware can be found in the Nerf-ATG-Firmware repository.

3. **Integration:**

   - Replace the original mainboard in the Nerf LaserOps blaster with the custom PCB.

4. **Unity App Setup:**

   - Install the Unity app from the Nerf-ATG-App repository on your device.
   - Pair the blaster with the app via Bluetooth.

## Usage

1. **Power On:**

   - Turn on the blaster.

2. **Connect to App:**

   - Open the Unity app and connect to the blaster via Bluetooth.

3. **Operation:**

   - Use the app to control and monitor the blasterâ€™s functions.
